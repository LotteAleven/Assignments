Does financial sector growth cause linear economic growth?

The causal relationship between financial and economic growth has been a popular research topic. One of the first papers discussing the relationship (Bagehot, 1873) argued that financial growth played a critical role in igniting industrialization in England. In the beginning of the 20th century Schumpeter states that banks lead to technological innovation. However, Robinson (1952) states that economic development causes financial development, while Lucas (1988) argues that the relationship between the two is not important.

Our research question is based on the paper by King and Levine (1993). They examine 80 countries over the period of 1960-1989 and control for other factors. Productivity growth and capital accumulation are measured and additional measures of the financial development level are added. They linearly predict the effect of financial development on economic growth, capital accumulation and productivity growth, and come to the conclusion that financial services increase efficiency of innovation and increase economic growth through this channel. Another conclusion they draw is that financial sector shocks cause a decreased growth rate in the new equilibrium. If the market is evaluated as usual, less evaluation is required when the return to innovation is lower. Therefore, entrepreneurs will not need as much financial means (appendix table 1).

Levine later published a paper in 1997, where the effect of financial markets on economic growth is explained in a figure (appendix figure 1). He argues that financial development crucially affects economic development and that there is evidence of this effect.

Later, a paper has been published about the empirical relationship between long-run growth and financial development (Guidotti and Gregorio, 1994). They included the ratio between bank credit to the private sector and GDP, where they find a positive and linear relationship between these variables. Moreover, the efficiency of investments is the most important factor influencing economic growth according to Guidotti and Gregorio. (appendix table 2).

Rioja and Valev (2004) regress different kinds of variables of financial growth on economic growth. They bundled countries in 3 groups, low, middle, and high income. They find that financial growth has more impact on higher income countries. In low or middle income countries they find the strongest relationship between capital accumulation and economic growth (appendix table 3).

The papers mentioned before all indicate a positive relationship between financial growth and economic development. However, there is evidence that this might not always be the case. Castro, Clementi and MacDonald (2004) elaborate on the topic of risk sharing and that this might reduce growth. They use a two period overlapping generations model to prove their point. Also Phillippon (2010), and Uras (2015) name some causes like rent-seeking, lending and trading frictions. Moreover, Law and Singh (2014) argue that too much finance can hurt economic growth. They indicate that there might be a threshold above which economic growth will decline. 

Motivation
---
We want to investigate the functional relationship between financial development and economic growth. The literature review indicates that there might be another relationship than linear between financial development and economic growth. A better financial system is defined by King and Levine as a bigger financial system, in other words higher amounts of the following variables:   
-	DEPTH = ratio of liquid liabilities to GDP
-	BANK = deposit bank domestic credit divided by deposit bank domestic credit plus central bank domestic credit
-	PRIVATE = ratio of claims on nonfinancial private sector to domestic credit
-	PRIV/Y = Gross claims on the private sector to GDP
Inspired by the banking/financial crisis, high debt levels and low current growth rates in developed countries (with a substantial financial system), we expect that a linear relationship between these variables and economic growth is too optimistic, and we want to examine potential diminishing returns. 

Research Design

To study the functional form of financial development on growth we will extent the empirical part of the paper of King and Levine. They reviewed and extended the analysis of 80 countries over the period 1960-1989 based on an earlier work (King and Levine 1993(a)). 
We will extend the data till 2015, in which we expect to find a diminishing effect of bigger financial systems on growth. The relationship between the four financial development indicators - DEPTH, BANK, PRIVATE, PRIV/Y - and the four growth indicators - GYP, GK, INV, PROD will be studied (appendix table 1). While King and Levine found linear and static effects, we will focus on dynamic effects. Therefore, cross-country time-series analysis will be used for this observational study. To examine diminishing returns of financial development on growth, quadratic variables of the financial development indicators will be included. The data from 1960 till 2015 can be collected from the same sources, which are the International Financial Statistics database (IFS) and the World Development Report. Since we keep our study as much as possible the same as King and Levineâ€™s, we will control for the same various combinations of variables (such as population growth, changes in terms of trade, domestic credit growth, standard deviation of inflation etc.).
